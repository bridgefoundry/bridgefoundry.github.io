It is with deep sadness that we write this update. Carolyn Van Slyck, a prominent member of Women Who Go and GoBridge, has passed away. She gave immense value to the organization, but more than that, she was a wonderful person to work with and this loss is felt deeply throughout the community.

When Women Who Go had a change of leadership, Carolyn was one of the first to volunteer to help run the organization. Whenever you needed anything, she would make it happen. She had a lot on her plate, but wanted to make sure GoBridge and WWG were supported and nourished. She was involved in everything, very communicative and helpful wherever she could be.

It is hard to find people like her, and we feel very lucky to have been able to work with her. She was an integral part of Women Who Go, and it wouldnâ€™t be where it is today without her support and contributions.

Thank you Carolyn.
