## Support Our Work!

Our mission is to **empower people** with technology through **teaching and facilitating access**, enlarging the community of people who **give back and teach others**.

### About your contribution

**Your donation is fully tax-deductible.** See [About BridgeFoundry](/about) for more non-profit details, including our EIN.

**All donations are provided to Bridge Foundry, Inc. as [unrestricted funds].** This is an important accounting distinction and allows Bridge Foundry to spend funds to support our mission, even in the unlikely event that the group you name below stopped being active. We will do our best to create activities with volunteers in our area that honor your donation, and appreciate that you are willing to support our shared mission: _to transform tech culture, by generating leaders, teachers and mentors who empower the underserved_.

You will receive a receipt via email after making your donation. If you want a physical receipt or for some reason don't receive it, or want to follow-up and hear more about our strategy and new initiatives, [contact us](mailto:hello@bridgefoundry.org).
