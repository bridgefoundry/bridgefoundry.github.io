# Study on Bias in Engineering with Actionable Outcomes for Engineering Leaders

Systemic bias is a widespread and still poorly understood problem in tech. Studies exist showing bias in engineering, yet many tech leaders who want to help still don't know exactly how to help.
Bridge Foundry has over a decade of experience creating positive change in the industry.
This research project is part of an initiative to create broader impact for our work.

## The Fundraiser

Bridge Foundry wants to commission a study which will more clearly underscore the issues of discrimination and outline concrete action items for tech leaders. We need your help to fundraise for it!

## The Problem
Gender bias in the tech industry remains a serious problem, and studies have consistently shown that women’s experiences are not uniform; differences in race, sexual orientation and gender identity increase the degree of abuse encountered. Sexual harassment is a significant and well-documented problem, which is being confronted head-on by many organizations. Yet other barriers persist as well, and these systemic problems are too often dismissed or overlooked. They include lack of promotion and recognition, ignoring or discounting ideas, differing bias affecting individuals who are raising children or caring for family members, and downright aggressive behavior. Invisible privilege and racial discrimination also impact women in tech, just as intersectionality around class, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and disability do.  While increased attention has shed light on these issues in recent years, successful implementation of changes that would alleviate or address these problems are severely lacking. Many industry leaders, while advocating for inclusion and diversity publicly, are not well informed on the breadth of issues related to bias in tech, and how it persists in limiting the full inclusion of valuable talent.  The cost to the industry is high, as individuals leave or are marginalized, and their talent is not fully leveraged.  

## Goals of The Study
As a tool to help industry leaders who are seeking to foster diversity and inclusion, this report will outline the existing dynamics of systemic bias in tech.  The report will show how gender bias, combined with race, class, age, sexuality, and disability bias, place undue burdens on individuals. We will highlight the ways that organizations reinforce these biases, negatively influencing decision making on many levels. We will identify specific areas that need redress, and recommend actions that can be taken. The research goal is to provide education that enables a more diverse workforce to thrive, unblocks innovation, and increases productivity in the industry.

## Research Details
We plan to interview at least 20 women from the tech industry, including several who have left. To ground our research we are also interviewing experts on systemic bias, equity and 
inclusion. This qualitative research will be a small sampling, as the goal is to illustrate well established quantitative data with narratives from the interviews. A diverse pool of interviewees will be selected, and based on prior research, we expect this to illustrate how other attributes such as race or disability compounded with gender discrimination can have an even more negative impact. 

Narratives will be selected from the interviews to help readers spot inappropriate behavior in their workplaces. For over a decade, we have witnessed volunteers return to their workplace after a workshop, after hearing the stories of minorities that they have worked with, suddenly unable to "unsee" discriminatory behavior in their own workplaces. This trend led to the development of our theory that stories alongside data will have a far greater impact than the data would alone.

The report will include recommendations on what steps can be taken to tackle the problems illustrated.  We will also  validate to what extent the report meets the goal, such as a before/after survey measuring individual perspectives/learnings from reading the report.

The study is being developed and produced in collaboration with [tEQuitable](https://www.tequitable.com/).

## About tEQuitable
[tEQuitable](https://www.tequitable.com/) is an independent, confidential, impartial, and off-the-record service that helps employees explore options for resolving conflicts, problems, or concerns in the workplace. They also identify trends and systemic issues in the organization and then recommend constructive changes to the leadership team for resolving systemic issues with a goal of promoting clarity and fairness.


## About BridgeFoundry
Since 2009, [Bridge Foundry](https://bridgefoundry.org/) has empowered people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others. Bridge Foundry was instrumental in the creation of the learn to code movement. Using our open-source curricula and teaching techniques, hundreds of workshops in dozens of cities around the world have been organized and taught by volunteers.

Bridge Foundry’s primary focus is on expanding diversity in specific technology communities which we call bridges. Each bridge focuses on a specific technology, or set of technologies, and shares open source curriculum and program materials with chapters across multiple geographies. Bridge Foundry supplies tools and operational support to the leaders of these chapters.

Bridge Foundry’s key differentiator from other tech training initiatives is its focus on training repeat participants as teachers. As teachers and leaders, Bridge Foundry volunteers learn to catch and correct disrespectful behavior in human interaction, along with gaps in technical understanding. While the focus is on technical skill development, we have anecdotal evidence that these skills also contribute to workplace transformation.

All of Bridge Foundry’s bridges and chapters focus on expanding diversity in tech via outreach to underrepresented groups. Seventy percent of workshop and outreach efforts have been targeted primarily at women with the remaining 30% focusing on other underrepresented groups.

In the US, Bridge Foundry, Inc., is a 501c3 tax-exempt organization. We support many community based initiatives in the US and other countries through grants and open source curricula.
